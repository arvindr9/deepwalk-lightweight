Things to do:

what format is the .embeddings file in?
each vertex is not associated with a class hmm

i need to separately have the embeddings for each node,
and the classes for each node, and do something of the
flavor that the NetMF repo does.

what format are the embeddings for NetMF saved in?

need to save the embeddings in .npy format instead
