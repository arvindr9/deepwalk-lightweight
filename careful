DeprecationWarning: Using or importing the ABCs from 'collections' instead of
from 'collections.abc' is deprecated since Python 3.3, and in 3.10 it will stop working

  File "/Users/arvindramaswami/Desktop/classes/cs7650_project/deepwalk2/skipgram.py", line 8, in <module>
    from gensim.models.word2vec import Vocab
ImportError: cannot import name 'Vocab' from 'gensim.models.word2vec' (/Users/arvindramaswami/anaconda3/envs/deepwalk/lib/python3.9/site-packages/gensim/models/word2vec.py)

so i just deleted this line, since it (at first glance) seems like it's not being used anywhere?

i need numpy 1.20.3 for blas to work
